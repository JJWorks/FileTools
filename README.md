# FileTools
There were restrictions in text editors for a particular company.  Large Data files were received, however many had incorrect data.  The ETL system would not hint on what the errors are.  Notepad could not handle opening these big files.

No restriction was given for creating programs.  Hence this program to retrieve the rows needed.  This allowed people to view to particular row giving problems and report it back to the sender.  Especially useful if the first few rows in a file is giving problems as generating the top 10 rows is faster than loading the file in a texteditor that can handle large files.
